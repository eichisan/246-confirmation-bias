## Pedagogical Purpose

This interactive activity is designed to help students experience confirmation bias firsthand while practicing scientific hypothesis testing. Students are given an initial numerical pattern (2–4–6) and may test as many sequences as they wish, receiving only “Yes” or “No” feedback. To discourage premature conclusions, students must perform multiple tests before proposing a hypothesis, reinforcing the idea that repeated confirming evidence does not establish correctness. The activity emphasizes the importance of designing disconfirming tests and illustrates a core principle of the scientific method: hypotheses cannot be proven true by confirmation alone but can be rapidly rejected through falsification. The goal is for students to internalize why scientists actively attempt to disprove their own ideas rather than seek only supporting evidence.
